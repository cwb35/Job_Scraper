are you ready for new challenges and new opportunities 
join our team 
current job opportunities are posted here as they become available 
institute overview 
the mission of the allen institute for cell science is to create dynamic and multi-scale visual models of cell organization  dynamics and activities that capture experimental observation  theory and prediction to understand and predict cellular behavior in its normal  regenerative  and pathological contexts 
program overview
students will be matched with mentors and projects based on degree of experience and mutual interests   in addition to working on a specific project  allen institute interns will meet regularly as a group in sessions designed to augment their research experience   these meetings could include sessions aimed at improving communication skills  opportunities to share their projects with peers  and discussions with allen institute scientists and staff representing different disciplines within the organization  at the end of the program  each intern will write up a project summary and give a presentation summarizing their work 
project summary 
title:
structuring cells: developing methods for automated segmentation of microscopy images
project overview:
the organization of cell comprises a multitude of molecular assemblies residing in specific compartments  active at specific times  their location and timing are critical  cancer  for example  results from molecules that are expressed at the wrong level  misplaced  or active all the time  somehow all of these assemblies work together to generate functioning cells—the question is  how 
our first major project will seek to understand the organization and morphologies of the major intracellular structures and regulatory complexes in undifferentiated stem cells and cardiomyocytes derived from them  to do this  we’ve added fluorescent markers to genome-edited cell lines and begun to use light microscopy to determine the numbers  locations  and dynamic changes of these intracellular structures and regulatory complexes  this unique data will be used to develop tools to predict relationships between structures within the cell and how they reorganize as the stem cell moves  divides  and differentiates  these data  in turn  will be to characterize and predict cell types and states as well as the effects of altered environments and mutations that cause disease  these efforts will culminate in the allen cell explorer—an online image database and tools to visualize  interrogate and annotate dynamic 3d images  cellular models  and other computational outputs 
in order to facilitate analyses of produced image data  we are exploring a number of methodologies as we develop and refine our modeling pipeline  the chief aim of this project is to develop a tool for 3d machine-learning based segmentation of digital images resultant from our high-throughput microscopy pipeline 
the tool will employ one or more approaches to segment 3d full color images  to be developed in python  documented on biorxiv and released as an open source package 
educational objectives:
eligibility 
compensation 
interns will receive  15 00 per hour which is equivalent to  6 000 less taxes 
housing
