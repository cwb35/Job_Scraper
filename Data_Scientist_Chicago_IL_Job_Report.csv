it has come to nielsen's attention that individuals misrepresenting themselves as nielsen representatives have offered fradulent employment opportunities  in some cases  job seekers are asked to pay a processing or work permit fee in order to secure an offer of employment  nielsen and our external recruiting/placement partners will never request credit card information or charge candidates an up-front fee of any kind
